# Why do this?
This survey is using a new style of survey UI that I developed in an attempt to improve 
the level of predicatbility when polling for skills.  "Beginner", "Medium", "Advanced" 
are completely subjective answers and do not inform us about the basic question of 
"what can you do?", when posed to an engineer. 

So ... we're going to get after what the capabilities are, not characterizations of 
levels.
