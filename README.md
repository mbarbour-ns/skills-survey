# Why do this?
- Improve the quality of the question:  This survey is using a new style of survey 
UI that I developed in an attempt to improve the level of predicatbility when polling 
for skills.  "Beginner", "Medium", "Advanced" are completely subjective answers and 
do not inform us about the basic question of "what can you do?", when posed to an 
engineer. Asking for capabilities is more informative than asking for a general 
characterization of abilities.
- establishing a performance metric will, in turn, improve our search abilities.  
- establishing a performance metric will allow us to set up a threshold to trigger
training to fill gaps in areas that have been identified as critical
- idetifying the critical areas will focus training curriculum to fit the actual 
need.  We can tailor training to target exactly what we need, which could lead to 
reduced and more effective training times.
